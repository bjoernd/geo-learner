## Geography Learning App

We will build an application that allows a kid to learn Geography with a focus
on Germany, its federal states, and neighbouring countries.

The main view of the app will be a map of central Europe that contains a full view
of Germany and partial view of its neighbouring countries.

There will be multiple modes:

- In "federal state mode", the kid will be shown the name of a German federal state. She will then
  click on the map and get a point if she clicks the right state. Then she will be asked for that
  state's capital through a popup and get another point if that answer is right.
- "Neighbor mode" will be an extension to federal state mode, where on top of federal states the kid
  will also click on where neighboring countries are. She will also need  to know their capitals.
- In "city mode", the kid will get the name of a city. On clicking on the map, she will point to
  where in Germany that city is. If the answer is correct, she'll get a point.
